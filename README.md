# Replace With Copy

Replace the selected objects with copies of the template object while keeping their transforms and scene placement intact.

## Highlights
- **Template-first workflow** – select the template first, then Shift-select the targets you want to replace.
- **Unique or linked data** – by default each replacement gets its own mesh/data block; hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> while triggering the menu entry to keep the copy linked instead.
- **Scene-aware** – parents, bone parenting, collection membership, and visibility flags are preserved on the new objects.
- **Undo friendly** – every run is a single undo step so you can experiment freely.

## How to Use
1. In Object Mode select the template object first.
2. Shift-select one or more target objects that should be replaced.
3. Choose `Replace With Copy` from the `Object` menu.
4. Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> while activating the menu entry to keep the replacements linked to the template's data.

The add-on targets Blender 4.2+ and is released under the GPLv3 license.
